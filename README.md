# Loan_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Python
Our aim of the project is to predict whether a applicant is eligible for a loan or not based on attribute like Loan_ID ,Gender,Married,Dependents,Education,Self_Employed ,ApplicantIncome ,CoapplicantIncome , Loan_Amount_Term , Credit_HistoryProperty_Area. 
This project is bassically based on classification problem in which pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries is used from python to extract insights from the data and xgboost, & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.
Thirdly, to learn how to hypertune the parameters using grid search cross validation for the xgboost machine learning model.

# Major observation from the data
1.Applicants who are male and married tends to have more applicant income then applicants who are unmarried male and female.
2.Applicants who are male and are graduated have more applicant income over the applicants who have not graduated.
3.Applicants who have more dependents have least applicant income whereas applicants which have no dependents have maximum applicant income
4.Applicants who are graduate and have credit history have more applicant income.
5.Applicants who have property in semiurban area and have credit history have maximum applicant income.
6.Loan Amount is linearly dependent on Applicant income.
7.From heatmaps, applicant income and loan amount are highly positively correlated
8.Male applicants are more than female applicants.
9.Applicants with no dependents are maximum
10.Applicants with graduation are more than applicants whith no graduation.
11.Property area is to be find more in semi urban areas and minimum in rural areas
